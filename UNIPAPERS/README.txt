Unipipapers by Team (Pi)  Rishi, Harsh, Sarbjeet.

Date : 2024-02-15
Time : 1400
Task1
Professor gave us a topic of product (paper)  and we did research on it.
1.How many types of papers 
2.Different colours
3.Size of paper
4.Different MM avaliable in papers.
and more

We also decided the company name as UNIPiPapers.
after research we gathered our findings and created a long list with their properties such as different
entities.

Oberservation
By doing research our team got to know varieties of paper and sizes and many more.

Task2 
We divided the task to each member that what part will be done by whom.

Task3
Date    :    2024-02-18
Time    :    1200
HOME PAGE 

We created home page by edit the views/homes/Index.cshtml file.
also added image for better experience for coustomers

Task4
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1200
Adding a Controller

The Controller folder contained the creation of the HellWorldController.cs file. 
We investigated both the HelloWorld and Welcome methods as instructed by the handbook. 

Task5
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1310
Adding view.

Creating the view is similar to creating the visual experience for the user.
The canvas is where the tastefully displayed info is found. We take pleasure in the creative part of this stage,
making sure the user has an aesthetically beautiful and intuitive interface in addition to receiving the information they require.

Task6
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1420
Adding Model

Building the model feels like building the application's backbone. It's where we store the logic 
for manipulating and retrieving data. We found delight in building a sturdy structure that protects data integrity
and acts as the system's base.

Task7
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1500
Creating Database
The further step is creating the database for the project
Connecting the program to a database is similarly to allocating memory for the system. 
It is the location where the program stores and retrieves data. We view it as offering the application a
mechanism to retain and recall facts, producing a more dynamic and meaningful experience for the user.

Task8
Date:     2024-02-18
Time:     1545
Adding Controllers.
Implementing controller actions feels like creating a dance between the user interface and the underlying data.
It's where I make judgments about how the application handles user input. Balancing this dance is critical for providing a 
seamless and responsive user experience.

Task9
Date:      2024-02-18
Time:      1650
Adding View.
Introducing search functionality is important. It's like giving consumers a magnifying glass to
explore and find exactly what they're looking for. We notice a sense of improvement in use, making the program
more user-friendly and efficient.

Roadblocks
We faced couple of errors while performing the tasks and we fixed the errors. We could'nt fix some errors such as sql database.

As we initially faced with some issues so we gathered at a place and did the job in one Laptop, but later on we have solved and did some work again
in different laptops.


We use Rishi's Laptop and divide tasks.

Rishi 

Created the web application and tested the apllication that its working or not? It was running successfully.
Moreover, added the controller in the "HelloWorldController.cs". After that, written the necessary code. 


Harsh

I modified the HelloWorldController class to use Razor view files. 
This cleanly encapsulates the process of generating HTML responses to a client.
Also, Update the Models/Papers.cs file with the following code. The MvcMovieContext object handles the task of connecting 
to the database and mapping UniPi papers objects to database records. 
The database context is registered with the Dependency Injection container in the Program.cs file.


Sarbjeet

I added search capability to the Index action method that searched paper by types or color etc. 
After that, Updated the Index method found inside Controllers/UniPipapers.cs with the following code. 
I updated Readme file as well.
